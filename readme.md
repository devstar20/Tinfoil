Overview
-------------------------

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has revolutionized the financial technology industry, providing users with more ways to invest and generate value than ever before. Yield aggregation in particular is a rising practice, making use of existing DeFi yield-generating protocols as well as prompting the development of additional yield aggregator projects. 
Tinfoil Finance provides a method for automating, carrying out, and improving yield compounding via the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem and the PancakeSwap protocol. This vastly simplifies yield aggregating, reduces gas fees, and enables individuals of all ranges of DeFi experience and available capital to benefit from the process.
Tinfoil Finance can be used for a multitude of yield farming purposes, including those seeking maximal yields and those seeking to balance risks and rewards. Thus, we aim to promote additional value and support to the underlying DeFi ecosystem.





Farms
-------------------------

Different vaults/farms require different LP tokens and risk tolerance levels. When APY is higher, there tends to be more volatility in the underlying token market. 

Currently, interest is compounded upon all farms except for the TIN staking farm and the TIN/BNB farm. Further, the TIN rewards coming from each pool are not compounded.

The range of farms available on our protocol are as follows:


* The TIN Staking Farm
This farm enables users to stake TIN Tokens and receive TIN back. 

* The TIN/BNB Farm
This farm lets users deposit TIN/BNB to earn additional TIN Tokens. 

* The CAKE Auto-Compounding Farm
This farm allows users to automatically compound interest on an already high APY. Users will be able to earn TIN Tokens via this farm.

* The Additional Tinfoil Finance Farms
These additional farms will include CAKE, BAKE, BIFI, AUTO, XVS, BUNNY, wSOTE, and BURGER, all existing on PancakeSwap. There will be a 5 times rewards multiplier on the TIN LP pool, a 3 times rewards multiplier on the TIN pool, and a 2 times multiplier on the CAKE and AUTO pools.

Tinfoilâ€™s smart contracts automatically compound the investments into these pools, augmenting the APY.  At present, users will be able to only claim profits upon exit from the pool, though this could change in the future.
